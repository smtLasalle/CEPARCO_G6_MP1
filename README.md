# CEPARCO_MP1

## C Program
This function efficiently computes the dot product by iterating through each element of the two input arrays, multiplying corresponding elements together, and summing up all the products. The dot product is a fundamental operation in various scientific and engineering computations, especially in vector mathematics and linear algebra. The function uses straightforward indexing and arithmetic operations, making it clear and easy to understand.


## x86-64 Program
This x86 assembly code snippet calculates the dot product of two arrays of double-precision floating-point numbers using SIMD instructions and XMM registers. The function initializes by zeroing out the xmm0 register to store the cumulative sum of products and clears the rax register for use as a loop counter. During each iteration of the loop, it loads corresponding elements from the arrays (addressed by rdx and r8) into xmm1 and xmm2. These elements are then multiplied together (mulsd), and the result is added to the cumulative sum in xmm0 (addsd). The loop continues until all elements are processed, incrementing rax after each iteration to advance the array index. The function concludes by zeroing rax for clean state management and returns, with the final dot product result stored in xmm0.


## x86 SIMD AVX2 assembly language using XMM register
With the usage of the XMM register, the solution was straightforward. SIMD operations and instructions such as movdqu and mulpd, made the solution almost “C” like. When first created, the solution was created in SASM first to test the proof of concept before implementing it into C to 86x. Trying to port over the SASM version into Visual Studio 2022, there were some adjustments to which registers were used. The solution can be broken down into two sections: multiply the array elements and add them to the final result. Utilizing the movdqu instruction, each element of both arrays is accessed by multiplying a counter variable by 8 throughout where the input is stored in the registry. With this, elements within the array are moved to their respective XMM registers (xmm1 and xmm2). The SSE2 floating point arithmetic instruction mulpd is then used to multiply xmm1 and xmm2 together. The result is added to the total result which is stored in the xmm0 register. The program loops however often it is set to which is based on the number of elements in both arrays. After a few tests with the final iteration of the YMM section of the program, it was noticed that there were small discrepancies in the decimal section of the output after kernel version 2^26 and onwards. With SIMD XMM and YMM registries, using large numbers and different arithmetic instructions may lead to the result being too large to represent or in the case of floating point, too small to represent (many decimal places). Floating point representation in IEEE-754, underflow occurs when the number is too small to represent. This causes the number to not be represented in full precision, also known as a gradual underflow.


## x86 SIMD AVX2 assembly language using YMM register
The YMM register allows more flexibility in where data is stored and can be more efficient when it comes to accessing. The first solution is where there were problems, the output was incorrect. Originally, there was an issue with the horizontal addition where it only added the partial sums and loop handling. The solution with using the YMM registers is similar to XMM, with the main difference being the usage of horizontal addition. As mentioned before, there is a small issue with the representation in kernels after 2^26 due to gradual underflow. With that in mind, the rest of program is similar to XMM counter part but the main difference being the usage of horizontal operations for better efficiency.
